  <h1>Cass' ART:222 Portfolio</h1>
  <h2> Project 1: Digital Design </h2>
  <p> My experiment centered on the vintage star projector from the planetarium as both a visual anchor and a point of curiosity. I designed a clean logo built around a spherical form, using balance, simple shapes, and negative space to keep the image readable and accessible for a wide audience that included students, children, and adults. The central image of the star projector was paired with a grounding environment. I used USM’s official branding colors directly from their hex codes and avoided gradients to maintain a clear, direct look that aligned with the university’s presence. Beginning with basic shapes and clean lines reflected values of education, structure, and clarity, while still leaving room for curiosity and whimsy. The vintage star projector served as an important influence, acting as a reference point that encouraged its viewers to consider how our understanding of the universe has evolved and to engage more deeply with the work.</p>
