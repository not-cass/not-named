  <h1>Cass' ART:222 Portfolio</h1>
  <h2> Project 1: Digital Design </h2>
  <p> This project focuses on the vintage star projector from the planetarium as the central point. I designed a clean logo built around a spherical form, using balance, simple shapes, and negative space to keep the image readable and widely accessible for an audience that included students, children, and adults. The central image of the star projector was paired with a grounding environment that is reminicent of a movie theater or viewing space. For the colors, I used USM’s official branding colors from their hex codes and avoided gradients to maintain a clear look that aligned with the university’s presence. I constructed this project using basic shapes and clean lines which reflects values of education and clarity, while still leaving room for curiosity and whimsy. The vintage star projector served as an important influence, acting as a reference point that encouraged viewers to consider how our understanding of the universe has evolved and to engage more deeply with the work.</p>

  <h2> Project 2: Photo Manipulation </h2>
  <p>In this experiment, I created a pair of opposing images: one depicting a utopia, the other a dystopia. The overarching theme explored how outdated technology could evolve into or with biology, and what that interaction might look like. These worlds mirror each other—one showing technology evolving symbiotically to enrich life, the other showing technology acting as a parasite, inhibiting evolution in living creatures.

This work posed questions about how society adapts to animals increasingly reliant on humans for survival. Some species are adjusting behaviorally and evolutionarily to urban environments, and incorporating technology served as a metaphor for the fossils of human society, similar to how we discover seashells or bones. </p>
  <h2> Project 3: Video Editing </h2>
  <h3> Experiment 1:</h3>
  <p> In this experiment, I started playing around with the initial idea of using electronic and organic fusion, before even thinking about my overall theme of my project.It is important to add this work as a precursor to my final project because it shows the level of growth I have achieved with photo manipulation.
  <p> This project explored the rejection of capitalist ideals surrounding productivity, efficiency, and time through the lens of queer punk resistance. It reflected a disillusionment with labor as identity and questioned the value systems that define worth through work and consumption. The piece reimagined idleness and captured moments of rebellion against the demand to constantly produce, perform, and progress.</p>
